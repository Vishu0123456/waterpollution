                                the aim of cleaning and restoring the lakes and other water bodies. They bring drying
                                and dying lakes back to life and help the people of Bengaluru fight shortage of water.
                                The Revive Lakes team consists of 30 volunteers, who are tirelessly working towards
                                cleaning the lakes and spreading awareness among people in the vicinity. The volunteers
                                of Bhumi meet every weekend with the sole aim to clean lakes and create a city, free
                                from water shortage.

                                The Vibhutipura Lake Project involved more than 250 volunteers, which helped the lake
                                get rid of more than 7,000 kg of garbage. Following the clean-up, the team also
                                conducted door-to-door campaigning to create awareness about conserving the water body
                                and keeping its surroundings clean. They also conduct many tree plantation drives in and
                                around Bengaluru.</p>

                                receive safe and sanitized drinking water. This NGO working towards the conservation of
                                water bodies in Maharashtra aims at ensuring that every family in its geography receives
                                their share of 200 litres of water per day through taps and pipes, in addition to other
                                basic facilities such as sanitation, healthcare and livelihood.
                                Additionally, to ensure that these water projects are sustainable, they create water
                                committees that are responsible for the processes and conservation of their community’s
                                water project.

                                Apart from domestic uses, water is also required for agricultural purposes. They have
                                taken up small tributaries and constructed check dams in order to conserve water for
                                domestic and agricultural purposes. The water thus conserved is supplied to the
                                agricultural lands through modern age technology, making the lives of the local farmers
                                sustainable and profitable and helping conserve the water bodies, in the process.

With “water” at the core of everything that it does, WOTR has started many initiatives that aim at conserving water bodies in India. 

                                As a simple yet unique step, they have started something called “water budgeting”, which involves “Jal Sevaks” to ensure optimal, rightful and efficient consumption of water. These Jal Sevaks lead the water conservation activities in their own and the adjoining 3-4 villages. In addition, they also aim at motivating and enabling rural communities toward water harvesting and conservation.
