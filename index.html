                                WATER POLLUTION : The contamination of water bodies such as rivers, lakes, etc. due to
                                several contaminants being discharged in them, directly or indirectly, is known as water
                                pollution. Water pollution has severe and hazardous impacts on our environment. In this
                                article, we will discuss the causes of water pollution.
                                The main water pollutants include bacteria, viruses, parasites, fertilisers, pesticides,
                                pharmaceutical products, nitrates, phosphates, plastics, faecal waste and even
                                radioactive substances. These substances do not always change the colour of the water,
                                meaning that they are often invisible pollutants.
                                Water pollution is the release of substances into bodies of water that makes water
                                unsafe for human use and disrupts aquatic ecosystems. Water pollution can be caused by a
                                plethora of different contaminants, including toxic waste, petroleum, and
                                disease-causing microorganisms.</P>

                                    the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 (the “Water Act”). The
                                    Water Act was enacted for the prevention and control of water pollution and
                                    prohibits the discharge of pollutants into the water system in excess of standards.
                                    It also provides for setting up Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for the
                                    central government and State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) for the state
                                    governments. The Water Act is in effect the first environmental regulation in India
                                    and was enacted before the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 was published. In
                                    1988, the Water Act was amended to bring its provisions in line with the Environment
                                    (Protection) Act, 1986. .</p>

                                    and, as a rule, no water laws can be enacted at the national level. Therefore, the
                                    basic tasks of the central government are limited to the formulation of a
                                    comprehensive plan for water resources management and coordination among the states.
                                    However, the Water Act was enacted under Article 252 of the Constitution as an
                                    exceptional national law on water. In 1975, the Water (Prevention and Control of
                                    Pollution) Rules, 1975 was enacted as a sub-regulation of the Water Act. The Rules
                                    set out payment, authority, budget and functions of CPCB in detail.

                                    a significant extent. According to Section 2 of this Act, industries include any
                                    operation or process or sewage or disposal treatment or any industrial effluent.
                                    Section 3 of this Act provides an exemption to industries from levying cess on those
